### Introduction

This is a ecommerce site built with Rails, still in developing phase and will be online soon. Watch my brief [walkthrough video](https://youtu.be/CJ8D2alZJOk) of this project.  

### Usage

clone the repo and install the needed gems locally:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Now you can run the app:
